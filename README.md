For practice during our course and for deeper understanding. Algorithms are written and tested using datasets to ensure correct implementation.

#### Bubble Sort

Contains a static method called ``sort();``, takes in an integer array as a parameter and returns the sorted array.

```java
// Example usage
int[] sortedArray = Bubble.sort(new int[] { 9,4,6,8,5,7,3,2,1 });
// sortedArray = { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 }
```
